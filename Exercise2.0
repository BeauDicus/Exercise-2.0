print("I think if there is a lot of code involved that is being used in the specific program then management software should be used. The reason for this is that I think it would help with having a better workflow by not being confused on which code does which. Additionally, this would help the user or users that are applying the code to have a much better direction of where the coding is being used in the program. To add on to this, I think it would help with organizing the code that is being used in the program which is being made. For example, this could be like organizing the main parts of the code that is really important which could be put in its separate location to what is being made by the user or users. Furthermore, I think management software could help with finding issues in code a lot easily because there is a possibility you do not have to scramble through the code that has been written.")
